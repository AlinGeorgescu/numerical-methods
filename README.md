# help-the-kids

Repository with the purpose of helping the young ones in need on their path to achieving the programmer wisdom.

PC:
- Follow "main.c", compile it with "gcc -lm" and run it as you read the code;
- Some helpful functions are implemented in "pointerutil.h";
- Leave any questions on the Facebook group.

PA:
- stick to whichever programming language you know better (C++/Java)

MN:
- Inainte sa va apucati de lucrat la ceva, verificati in "Pull requests" ca n-a facut nimeni asta deja!
- Conventie: Metodele se vor numi cu litera mare => "Crout", "Doolittle", "Householder", "Givens" etc.
- Use notation tags:
	- [NOTE] for related notes
	- [USES] for sources which use other sources that are in a different folder to suggest that the user should first copy the dependencies (sources needed) in the same folder for testing
